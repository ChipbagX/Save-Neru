A friend group was captured by the fallen angel of fate, and imprisoned into a video game, forged by one of the friend's interests.
The game is now controlled by one of the friends, and holds the code together, forcing the outside player (YOU playing as a friend named ZEIA) has to play the game to free them all. (Acksel Boss Route TRUE ENDING)
