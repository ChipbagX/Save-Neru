When Kevin Boss is defeated, and END CUTSCENE is unlocked, continue and do NOT press "End Game", wait for a while and a fun ending will appear (You die)
Click on "Teto" to unlock TRUE ENDING (cannot be done while doing "Acksel" Boss)
Click on "Kevin" Boss to unlock "Acksel" Boss
Acksel Boss is harder than the Kevin Boss, and gets more difficult in his last health stages. (HEALTH REGEN cooldown will be decreased to 6 seconds, final stages will lead to 1.5 seconds)
When Acksel Boss is complete, Neru will give shock at the end because this is a secret ending, duh.
Before game autoends after Acksel Boss is complete, click "Neru" to start the BEST ENDING route.
BEST ENDING route will lead to the FINAL BOSS. PLAYER WILL TURN INTO "SUPER MIKU" SPAM E ON "X" BOSS TO DRAIN HEALTH, 30 HITS MUST BE DONE. (NO HEALTH REGEN) TIMER HITS 0 GAME LEADS TO WORST ENDING. COMPLETE BOSS AND YOU WILL UNLOCK TRUE ENDING
